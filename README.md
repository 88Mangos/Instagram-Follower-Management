First, install Python (pip should come with it).
If you are new to coding, you will use Python's IDLE integrated development environment (IDE). If you are experienced, you can use VSCode or any other code editor of your choice.

You will also need the Firefox browser to do this. If you do not have Firefox installed, download it here: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/

Once you have Python installed, use pip to install the pandas package and the instaloader package.

pip install pandas

pip install instaloader
